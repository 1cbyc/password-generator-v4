# passwrod-generator-v4

the thing is, this project was first built with c# by me 3 years ago. i intend to modify it solely in C, since i have some personal needs for that.

Core Functionality:

    Generate strong random passwords of variable lengths.
    Include options for character sets (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols).
    Allow users to specify the length and complexity.
